1. Run **"Live Server Lite: Toggle HTTPS/HTTP"**
2. Select **"🛡️ HTTPS (Secure)"** from the dropdown
3. Start the server normally - it will use HTTPS protocol

**Method 3: Enable HTTPS in Settings**
```json
{
  "liveServerLite.https": true,
  "liveServerLite.https.port": 3443,
  "liveServerLite.https.autoGenerateCert": true
}
```

### **🛡️ Certificate Management**

**Automatic Certificate Generation**
- Live Server Lite automatically creates self-signed certificates
- Perfect for development and testing secure contexts
- No manual setup required - works out of the box!

**Custom Certificates**
```json
{
  "liveServerLite.https.certPath": "/path/to/your/cert.pem",
  "liveServerLite.https.keyPath": "/path/to/your/key.pem"
}
```

**Generate New Certificates**
- Command: **"Live Server Lite: Generate SSL Certificate"**
- Specify custom domain (default: localhost)
- View certificate location and update settings

### **⚙️ HTTPS Configuration**

Add these settings to your `settings.json` for HTTPS customization:

```json
{
  // Enable HTTPS by default
  "liveServerLite.https": true,
  
  // HTTPS-specific settings
  "liveServerLite.https.port": 3443,
  "liveServerLite.https.domain": "localhost",
  "liveServerLite.https.autoGenerateCert": true,
  "liveServerLite.https.warnOnSelfSigned": true,
  "liveServerLite.https.certPath": "",  // Leave empty for auto-generation
  "liveServerLite.https.keyPath": ""    // Leave empty for auto-generation
}
```

### **🔧 Handling Browser Security Warnings**

When you access `https://localhost:3443`, browsers will show security warnings like:
- **Chrome/Edge**: "Your connection is not private" with `NET::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID`
- **Firefox**: "Warning: Potential Security Risk Ahead"
- **Safari**: "This Connection Is Not Private"

**This is completely normal and expected for self-signed certificates in development!**

**How to Proceed Safely:**

1. **Chrome/Edge**: 
   - Click **"Advanced"**
   - Click **"Proceed to localhost (unsafe)"**
   - Browser remembers this choice for the session

2. **Firefox**:
   - Click **"Advanced"**  
   - Click **"Accept the Risk and Continue"**

3. **Safari**:
   - Click **"Show Details"**
   - Click **"Visit this website"**
   - Confirm **"Visit Website"**

**Pro Tips:**
- ✅ These warnings are **safe to ignore** for `localhost` development
- ✅ The connection **is actually encrypted** between browser and server
- ✅ Only the certificate **authority is not recognized** (self-signed)
- ✅ Your data remains **protected during development**

**For Production:** Use certificates from trusted Certificate Authorities (Let's Encrypt, etc.)

**Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)**
```json
{
  "liveServerLite.https": true,
  "liveServerLite.https.domain": "localhost"
}
```
Perfect for testing service workers, push notifications, and offline functionality.

**API Development & Testing**
```json
{
  "liveServerLite.https": true,
  "liveServerLite.https.port": 3443,
  "liveServerLite.cors": true
}
```
Test secure API endpoints and cross-origin requests.

**Custom Domain Testing**
```json
{
  "liveServerLite.https": true,
  "liveServerLite.https.domain": "myapp.localhost",
  "liveServerLite.https.port": 443
}
```
Test with custom domains (requires hosts file modification).

### **🚨 Security Warnings & Browser Setup**

**Expected Browser Warnings**
When using self-signed certificates, browsers will show security warnings. This is normal for development!

**Chrome/Edge**: Click "Advanced" → "Proceed to localhost (unsafe)"
**Firefox**: Click "Advanced" → "Accept the Risk and Continue"  
**Safari**: Click "Show Details" → "Visit this website"

**Disable Warnings (Development Only)**
- Chrome: Launch with `--ignore-certificate-errors-spki-list --ignore-certificate-errors --ignore-ssl-errors-spki-list --ignore-ssl-errors`
- Add to VS Code settings:
```json
{
  "liveServerLite.browserArgs": [
    "--ignore-certificate-errors",
    "--ignore-ssl-errors"
  ]
}
```

### **🔍 HTTPS Troubleshooting**

**Issue: "Certificate not trusted"**
- **Solution**: This is expected for self-signed certificates
- **Action**: Click through browser warning or use custom certificates

**Issue: "HTTPS server failed to start"**
- **Solution**: Check port availability and certificate paths
- **Action**: Try different port or regenerate certificates

**Issue: "Mixed content warnings"**  
- **Solution**: Ensure all resources (CSS, JS, images) use HTTPS URLs
- **Action**: Use relative URLs or configure your build process

**Issue: "Service worker not registering"**
- **Solution**: Service workers require HTTPS or localhost
- **Action**: Use HTTPS server instead of HTTP for PWA development

### **🛠️ Advanced HTTPS Setup**

**Creating Trusted Local Certificates with mkcert**

For a seamless development experience without browser warnings:

1. **Install mkcert**:
   ```bash
   # macOS (Homebrew)
   brew install mkcert
   
   # Windows (Chocolatey)
   choco install mkcert
   
   # Windows (Scoop)
   scoop bucket add extras
   scoop install mkcert
   
   # Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)
   sudo apt install mkcert
   ```

2. **Setup local Certificate Authority**:
   ```bash
   # Install local CA (one-time setup)
   mkcert -install
   
   # This creates a local CA trusted by your browser
   ```

3. **Generate trusted certificates**:
   ```bash
   # Navigate to your project directory
   cd /path/to/your/project
   
   # Generate certificates for localhost
   mkcert localhost 127.0.0.1 ::1
   
   # This creates:
   # - localhost+2.pem (certificate)
   # - localhost+2-key.pem (private key)
   ```

4. **Configure Live Server Lite**:
   ```json
   {
     "liveServerLite.https": true,
     "liveServerLite.https.certPath": "./localhost+2.pem",
     "liveServerLite.https.keyPath": "./localhost+2-key.pem",
     "liveServerLite.https.autoGenerateCert": false
   }
   ```

5. **Start server**: No more browser warnings! 🎉

**Custom Domain Development**

Test with custom domains like `myapp.localhost`:

1. **Update hosts file** (requires admin/sudo privileges):
   ```bash
   # macOS/Linux
   echo "127.0.0.1 myapp.localhost" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
   
   # Windows (run as Administrator)
   echo 127.0.0.1 myapp.localhost >> C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts
   ```

2. **Generate domain certificates**:
   ```bash
   # Generate certificates for custom domains
   mkcert myapp.localhost "*.myapp.localhost"
   ```

3. **Configure settings**:
   ```json
   {
     "liveServerLite.https": true,
     "liveServerLite.https.domain": "myapp.localhost",
     "liveServerLite.https.certPath": "./myapp.localhost+1.pem",
     "liveServerLite.https.keyPath": "./myapp.localhost+1-key.pem"
   }
   ```

4. **Access your app**: Visit `https://myapp.localhost:3443` with no warnings!

**Alternative: Disable Browser Security (Development Only)**

For quick testing without certificate setup:

```json
{
  "liveServerLite.browserArgs": [
    "--ignore-certificate-errors",
    "--ignore-ssl-errors",
    "--disable-web-security",
    "--allow-running-insecure-content"
  ]
}
```

⚠️ **Warning**: Only use these flags for development. Never use in production!

}
```

### **🚨 Smart Memory Warning Behavior**

**Before v1.1.0 (Bad UX):**
- ❌ Warnings every 30 seconds regardless of server state
- ❌ Spam warnings even when extension is idle  
- ❌ Low 200MB threshold causing false alarms
- ❌ No learning from user behavior

**After v1.1.0 (Smart UX):**
- ✅ Warnings **only when server is actively running**
- ✅ 30-second grace period after server start
- ✅ Maximum 3 warnings per session with 5-minute cooldowns
- ✅ 500MB threshold for genuinely problematic memory usage
- ✅ Auto-reset when memory normalizes or server stops
- ✅ One-click optimization suggestions with actionable solutions

**Example Smart Warning:**
```
⚠️ Live Server is using 612MB of memory (running for 5m 23s). 
This is unusually high and may affect performance. (2 more warnings this session)

## ❓ FAQ & Troubleshooting

### **🔧 Common Issues**

#### **Q: "Port already in use" error**
**A:** The default port (5500) is being used by another application.

**Solutions:**
1. **Automatic**: Live Server Lite will try the next available port (5501, 5502, etc.)
2. **Manual**: Change the port in settings:
   ```json
   {
     "liveServerLite.port": 3000
   }
   ```
3. **Find conflicting process**:
   - **Windows**: `netstat -ano | findstr :5500`
   - **macOS/Linux**: `lsof -i :5500`

#### **Q: Browser shows HTTPS security warnings**
**A:** This is normal and expected when using self-signed certificates for development.

**Solutions:**
1. **Accept the warning**: Click "Advanced" → "Proceed to localhost" (this is safe for development)
2. **Use HTTP for basic development**: Set `"liveServerLite.https": false`
3. **Disable warnings for development**: Add browser arguments:
   ```json
   {
     "liveServerLite.browserArgs": [
       "--ignore-certificate-errors",
       "--ignore-ssl-errors",
       "--disable-web-security"
     ]
   }
   ```
4. **Custom certificates**: Use your own trusted certificates:
   ```json
   {
     "liveServerLite.https.certPath": "./ssl/cert.pem",
     "liveServerLite.https.keyPath": "./ssl/key.pem",
     "liveServerLite.https.autoGenerateCert": false
   }
   ```

#### **Q: HTTPS server fails to start**
**A:** Certificate generation or server binding issues.

**Solutions:**
1. **Check port availability**: Try a different HTTPS port:
   ```json
   {
     "liveServerLite.https.port": 8443
   }
   ```
2. **Certificate generation failed**: Regenerate certificates using:
   - Command: `Live Server Lite: Generate SSL Certificate`
   - Or restart VS Code to reset certificate cache
3. **Permission issues**: Ensure VS Code has write access to workspace
4. **Fallback to HTTP**: Extension automatically falls back to HTTP if HTTPS fails
5. **Clear certificate cache**: Delete `.vscode/certificates` folder in workspace

#### **Q: Mixed content warnings in HTTPS**
**A:** Loading HTTP resources from HTTPS pages causes security warnings.

**Solutions:**
1. **Use relative URLs**: `src="./script.js"` instead of `src="http://..."`
2. **Protocol-relative URLs**: `src="//cdn.example.com/lib.js"`
3. **Update resource URLs**: Change HTTP URLs to HTTPS
4. **Configure build tools**: Update webpack/parcel to use HTTPS URLs
5. **Development mode**: Use `--disable-web-security` browser flag (development only)

#### **Q: Service workers not working in development**
**A:** Service workers require HTTPS or localhost for registration.

**Solutions:**
1. **Enable HTTPS**: 
   ```json
   {
     "liveServerLite.https": true
   }
   ```
2. **Use localhost**: Ensure you're accessing via `https://localhost:PORT`
3. **Accept certificate**: Click through browser security warnings
4. **Check console**: Look for service worker registration errors
5. **Clear browser cache**: Hard refresh with `Ctrl+Shift+R`

#### **Q: Custom domain certificates not working**
**A:** Certificate domain doesn't match the access URL.

**Solutions:**
1. **Generate certificate for correct domain**:
   ```json
   {
     "liveServerLite.https.domain": "myapp.localhost"
   }
   ```
2. **Update hosts file** (requires admin privileges):
   ```
   # Add to /etc/hosts (macOS/Linux) or C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts (Windows)
   127.0.0.1 myapp.localhost
   ```
3. **Access via correct URL**: Use `https://myapp.localhost:3443`
4. **Regenerate certificate**: Run `Live Server Lite: Generate SSL Certificate`

#### **Q: "File permission denied" errors**
**A:** The extension can't access certain files or directories.

**Solutions:**
1. **Check VS Code permissions**: Ensure VS Code has file system access
2. **Workspace permissions**: Verify you have read/write access to project folder
3. **Exclude restricted folders**:
   ```json
   {
     "liveServerLite.ignoreFiles": [
       "node_modules/**",
       ".git/**",
       "**/restricted/**"
     ]
   }
   ```
4. **Run as administrator** (Windows) or `sudo` (macOS/Linux) if necessary

#### **Q: Live reload not working**
**A:** Browser isn't receiving WebSocket updates.

**Solutions:**
1. **Check WebSocket connection**: Open browser DevTools → Network → WS tab
2. **Firewall settings**: Allow VS Code and the port through firewall
3. **Browser compatibility**: Ensure WebSocket support (all modern browsers)
4. **Restart server**: Stop and start Live Server Lite
5. **Manual refresh**: Use `Ctrl+F5` / `Cmd+F5` for hard refresh

#### **Q: Network access not working from other devices**
**A:** Other devices can't reach your development server.

**Solutions:**
1. **Check network settings**:
   ```json
   {
     "liveServerLite.host": "0.0.0.0",
     "liveServerLite.useNetworkInterface": true
   }
   ```
2. **Firewall configuration**: Allow the port through your system firewall
3. **Network connectivity**: Ensure devices are on the same network
4. **IP address**: Use the network IP shown in VS Code status bar
5. **Router settings**: Check if router blocks inter-device communication

#### **Q: Memory warning notifications - are they annoying?**
**A:** No! v1.1.0 introduced smart memory warnings that respect your workflow.

**Smart Warning Behavior:**
- **Only warns when server is running** - No warnings when you're not using Live Server
- **Grace period** - Waits 30 seconds after server start before monitoring  
- **Smart throttling** - Maximum 3 warnings per session with 5-minute cooldowns
- **Auto-reset** - Warning system resets when memory normalizes or server stops
- **Higher threshold** - 500MB default (vs 200MB before) for fewer false alarms

**If you see a warning:**
1. **Click "Optimize Settings"** for one-click optimization
2. **Click "Restart Extension"** to clear memory immediately
3. **Click "Dismiss"** to increase warning frequency (learns from your preference)

**Disable warnings completely:**
```json
{
  "liveServerLite.performance.monitoring": false
}
```

#### **Q: High CPU usage or slow performance**
**A:** File watching is consuming too many resources.

**Solutions:**
1. **🆕 Enable large project optimization (enabled by default)**:
   ```json
   {
     "liveServerLite.watcher.largeProjectOptimization": true,
     "liveServerLite.watcher.batchEvents": true,
     "liveServerLite.watcher.batchDelay": 250,
     "liveServerLite.watcher.useNativeWatcher": true
   }
   ```

2. **Exclude large directories**:
   ```json
   {
     "liveServerLite.ignoreFiles": [
       "node_modules/**",
       "dist/**",
       "build/**",
       "**/*.log",
       "**/cache/**"
     ]
   }
   ```
3. **Increase debounce delay**:
   ```json
   {
     "liveServerLite.debounceDelay": 1000
   }
   ```
3. **Close unused files**: Reduce VS Code's file watching overhead
4. **Project size**: Consider splitting very large projects

### **🛠️ Advanced Troubleshooting**
