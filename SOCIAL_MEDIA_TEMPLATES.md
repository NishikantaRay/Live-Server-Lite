### Technical Deep Dive

🔧 Technical Deep Dive: Why I chose TypeScript and WebSocket for Live Server

When building a VS Code extension for live web development, architectural decisions matter for both developer experience and performance.

Key Technical Choices:

🎯 TypeScript over JavaScript
• 25+ comprehensive interfaces for type safety
• Compile-time error detection  
• Better VS Code API integration
• Maintainable codebase as features grow

⚡ WebSocket over HTTP Polling  
• Real-time browser communication
• Lower latency for file change detection
• Better battery life on mobile devices
• Scalable to multiple browser tabs

🏗️ Modular Architecture
• Separate concerns: server, file watching, UI
• Easier testing and maintenance
• Clean separation of HTTP/HTTPS logic
• Extensible for future features

🧪 Test-Driven Development
• 100+ automated tests for reliability
• Cross-platform compatibility testing
• Edge case handling (port conflicts, permissions)
• Certificate generation validation

The result: A developer tool that's both powerful and reliable, with professional-grade architecture that can scale with user needs.

Hey r/webdev! 👋

I was getting tired of manually refreshing browsers during development and struggling with local HTTPS setup, so I built a VS Code extension to solve these issues.

**Live Server - Auto Reload & Static Server**

🎯 What it does:
• Right-click any HTML file → "Open with Live Server"
• Auto-refreshes browser on file saves (HTML, CSS, JS)
• Built-in HTTPS with automatic SSL certificates  
• Network URLs for testing on mobile devices
• Multi-browser support

🔧 Why I built it:
• Existing solutions were either too heavy or missing HTTPS
• Needed something that "just works" without configuration
• Wanted proper TypeScript architecture and testing

✅ Perfect for:
- Static sites and SPAs
- PWA development (needs HTTPS)
- Mobile-first responsive testing
- Quick prototypes and demos

The extension is free, open source, and has 100+ automated tests for reliability.
